# ecoton-laravel
My first laravel project

I should made website for company during ecoton and before starting development my laravel knowladge used be equal to zero. I wrote tones of dirty code without knowing any pattern and any concept of OOP in 7 days(like a God).

To enter the the Admin panel type domain.name/login into url and fill form with data from Admin.php config. Default login: kernelminer password: BofP23U@ #If you did not change config, type default login and password
